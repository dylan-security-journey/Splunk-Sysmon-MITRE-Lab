# Splunk-Sysmon-MITRE-Lab
Hands-on blue team lab using Splunk Enterprise and Sysmon to collect and analyze Windows event data. Built custom SPL detections mapped to MITRE ATT&amp;CK techniques (Execution, Persistence, C2) and validated them with simulated adversary behaviors. Includes setup guides, detection queries, and dashboards for threat hunting practice.
